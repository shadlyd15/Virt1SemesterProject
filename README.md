# Semester Project - Virtualization 1 WS2019 / 2020
## Bergische Universität Wuppertal

### Project 
In Docker you should run a MQTT message broker and a database as well as some glue code (3 containers)

### Tasks
1. a container with a standard MQTT server of your choice and
2. a database of your choice. Configure both accordingly.
3. Write a code that calculates prime numbers and sends them to your server, which uses the
MQTT protocol. The glue code picks the numbers from MQTT and writes them into a
database of your choice inside containers.
4. Develop a way to show your results.

## Directories
