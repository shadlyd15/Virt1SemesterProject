Hello

Hope you are doing well. We have selected "MQTT,â€¦" as my semester project for Virtualization 1 course. I have a few question regarding this project.
As far as I could understand, we need to create 3 container.

	Container 1 : MQTT Broker
	Container 2 : Database
	Container 3 : Python application to subscribe to a topic and store received prime numbers in the database (Container 2)

Now my questions are

1) "Write a code that calculates prime numbers and sends them to your server" - where this entity will be?
	Will this application be in another container? 
	Or can we just launch it localy?

2) "Develop a way to show your results"
	Should we develop a web/desktop application to show the result?
	Should we put this entity in another container?

Eagerly waiting for your kind reply. Thanks in advance.

Regards
